* bang.el

~bang.el~ allows one to [[https://duckduckgo.com/][DuckDuckGo's]] [[https://duckduckgo.com/bang][!Bang]] from the comfort of Emacs.

It adds special support for Org-roam, with the function ~bang-roam~ allowing one to search with the roam node's title, and ~bang-roam-wiki~, which does the same for Wikipedia.

** Installation

** Usage

Internally, the functions all call ~browse-url~. To choose which program is used, one can edit the values of ~browse-url-browser-function~ and ~browse-url-generic-function~ as documented [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BrowseUrl][here]].
